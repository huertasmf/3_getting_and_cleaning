This repo contains the files required by the course project.

### File List
- **run_analysis.R** The R script for processing data and generating the tidy data

###Process run_analysis
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set 
  with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

### Output
 The script generate this file **tidy_data.txt** containing the Tidy Data  of step 5 consisting of the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

### Tidy data description
The tidy data generated by following the steps outlined in **_Codebook.md_**
